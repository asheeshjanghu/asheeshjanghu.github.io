Hi there, this is my personal blog of `Data Science`. I’m a former accountant who have found real passion and strength in data science. Here I share my own curriculum covering from the basics of computer science to the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Below are the materials I used to teach myself and make tutorials. Tutorials are available above.
